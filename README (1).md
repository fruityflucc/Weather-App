# Weather App

Its a simple app/website tool I made using the weather api from [Open weather map](https://openweathermap.org/) which i implemented into the design, you enter a city's name it will show you the current temprature, wind speed and humidity but if the entered city name is wrong it will show "Invalid city name!".

## Usage

- If you want to check the weather of any city across the globe.
